# pauld4.github.io

My github.io site that contains small portions of my work in HTML and JavaScript. I enjoy writing my own JavaScript code, but will use AI to help create a foundation for the JavaScript code. AI is also used to help with the CSS and layout.

Index.html
The homepage to the site, includes a menu with 3 buttons.

Login.html
A JavaScript login page, storing usernames and passwords in the user's client with localstorage.

Lights.html
A JavaScript game using the HTML canvas and continually draws a new image to the screen and responds to input using a game loop. Try to make all the squares blue within 3 clicks. It is possible to make all the squares white, but will require more clicks.

Shop.html
Work in progress, but will be another JavaScript game that requires the user to click on items on a store shelf based on what item is shown on their shopping list.
